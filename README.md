# Crack Surface Classification using InceptionV3

## Overview
Concrete surface cracks are major defect in civil structures. Building inspection whis is done for the evaluation of rigidity and tensile strength of the building. Crack detection plats a major role in the building inspection, finding the cracks and determining the building health. Therefore, we built a model the using transfer learning algorithm InceptionV3 to classify the crack surfaces, determining whether they have cracks or not.

## Pre-requisite Packages
- **Python** : You need to install 3.9 or later
- **IDE** : You need to install an IDE to run the program, I recommend you to install VS Code
- **Library** : To run this program you need to install requirements.txt

## Installation
1.  Clone this repository to your local device using `.git`:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/FariskaRatna/crack-surface-inceptionv3
    ```
2.  Change your terminal into the new subdirectory:
    ```
    cd crack-surface-inceptionv3
    ```
3.  Then openin Visual Studio Code:
    ```
    code .
    ```
4.  If the Python requires a virtual environment, create and activate the virtual environment in the terminal
    ```
    python -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
5.  Install project depedencies using:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
